<H1>About Our Bakery</H1>
<hr />
<p>Founded in 2010, Sweet Treats began as a small family-owned bakery in the heart of the town. 
What started as a passion for baking quickly grew into a beloved local spot, 
known for our homemade recipes passed down through generations. 
Our founder, Maria Johnson, was inspired by her grandmother's traditional baking techniques, which emphasized fresh, high-quality ingredients and a love for the craft.
Over the years, Sweet Treats has become a gathering place for the community, where people can enjoy everything from classic cookies to innovative pastries. We’ve expanded our offerings to include gluten-free and vegan options, ensuring that everyone can find something to love at our bakery.
At Sweet Treats, we believe in the magic of baking and the joy it brings to people's lives. Our mission is to continue creating delicious, handcrafted baked goods that bring a smile to every face.</p>
